Predicting a Biological Response

- This is a modern solution of the [original the tutorial](http://blog.kaggle.com/?p=2870) on Python for Data Science for the Kaggle competition: [Predicting a Biological Response](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bioresponse). This is done so by:
    - Using `pandas` instead of `numpy.genfromtxt` for loading data
    - Using `sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score` instead of `cross_validation`
